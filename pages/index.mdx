## A blog about planning and executing a series of challanges for the year 2023.

I turn 40-years-old in Janurary. It felt like a good time to get uncomfortable and challenge myself to do more. It 
should be quite the experience, so I thought I'd write about it. I'm more concerned about staying consistent with the
challenges than keeping up with this blog. We'll see how it goes.
