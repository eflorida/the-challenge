### Read for at least 30 minutes per day
#### Jan 01 - Feb 09

Welcome, 2023! Time to start challenge 1! I wanted to start with reading because it's one of those everyday things I really wish I did more of, so why not work on making it a daily habit. I enjoy reading and already own a number of books I've been meaning ot read, but I have just not been in the habit.

I also really wanted to start with a daily challenge. Another thing I struggle with is doing something every day. I am very protective of my schedule (time) and I like to have flexibility to make in-the-moment decisions on what to do. So something I "have" to do every day means sometimes there won't be a convinient time, or I'll have to interrupt something else to get it in. In reality, if I care about my time, building a habit for important, but also smaller tasks is a great opportunity.

In many ways, building a habit is like automating it. While you still have to do it, and it takes your time, it takes far less of your mental capacity, which makes room for bigger, more challenging tasks in your day.

The goal of starting with this challenge is that throughout 2023 I read significantly more than last year, not just that I read 30 minutes a day for 40 days. In general, the challenges are about so much more than just the actual act, or time frame, or completing them. Sometimes you just can't avoid saying it - it's the journey, not the destination. The process of attemping the challenges, the experiences and learnings, and the habits formed, make the sum greater than the parts.

I'm also trying out an app to track my habit. It feels silly, using an app to track a single habit, but I wanted to actually "log" somewhere to help enforce accountability.
