Mid-morning in the living room, beermosa with Firestone 805 and 90's pop-rock playlist.

### It's the last day of 2022!

I want to work through some reflections for 2022 today. It's easy for us to look forward and get caught up what we're planning for the next year - new goals, new achievements, a promotion at work, doing better at X. However, it's important to look back and also appreciate all that you have accomplished so far, as well.

I recommend looking back through the photos you've taken to remind yourself of the adventures, trips, friends, family, etc.

A commitment to physical fitness is one of the first things that comes to mind for me. I used to be a fairly consistent runner (since living in California), but had never done any kind of cross-training, mobility, recovery, etc. I originally joined Equinox to train for a marathon and my first ultra-marathon, knowing I would need more strength and mobility.

I re-joined Equinox to kick-start exercise again after a long hiatus through COVID. There really was no reason I couldn't keep running throughout the pandemic, but for various excuses, I got out of the habit and basically went 1.5 years without really exercising at all. Running was all I wanted to do when I joined, which you don't technically need a gym for, but I knew I just needed to get in basic shape and re-form the habit and having a nice gym and classes I could sign up for would help create the habit. It worked, and then I signed up for personal-training twice a week. This really got me working towards running goals and improving overall strength and fitness. It's been a fantastic journey and I'm just excited to see how much further I can go!

Below are some year-end reflection ideas from a newsletter I really like, from [James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/).

<aside>
It's one year from now. December 2023. The habit you were hoping to build during the year didn't stick. What is the most likely reason it failed?

<aside>
At the end of each year, I ask myself two questions:
1. What do I want to create in this New Year?
2. What do I want to let go of?
