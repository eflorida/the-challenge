Well, here we are. I’m spinning Black Pumas on the record player and drinking Mumm Napa Brut.

If you aren’t a programmer the title may not be as obvious, but it’s the standard first thing you learn when learning a new language - how to output “Hello, World” using the language. One of many little quirks I appreciate about the history and industry that is software engineering. So it seemed like a good way to start here.

So I just figured I’d document my experience building and taking on these challenges. Challenging ourselves means getting comfortable with uncomfortable. And change only happens in moments of discomfort. However, the world we live in works **really** hard to make sure we are as comfortable as possible. Many people spent much of their time and money avoiding discomfort. Change is hard.

I want to continue to grow and learn in this life. I turn 40 this year, and it’s a milestone that commonly makes you reflect on how much life you have lived and how much more life you have left to live. Which I think is really asking how much you intend to experience. I like that word a lot more than “accomplish.” The point is to be a part of moments, some of those may be completing a task or reaching a milestone, such as in your career or buying a house, but what matters more is the experience of planning and taking the actions that lead to those moments.

It’s the joy of the work, versus the happiness in a moment when a milestone/goal is achieved. That’s a passing moment of celebration, nobody lives a good life by having a few major milestones, they live a good life by finding joy along the path towards those possible milestones. That means even ones that never came, the process of attempting could still bring joy.

Notice how hard I worked to avoid the word “journey” much less the colloquial “it’s the journey, not the destination.” Sometimes common phrases become common because they really are universal truths, but they also tend to lose their meaning.

Anyways, I digress. And will continue to throughout these posts and this journey, and likely any writing on I do in life. But I worked hard not to go on my “milestones vs goals” soapbox, so there’s that.

So back to discomfort. I don’t know where this accounting of my experience will lead. I don’t know if I’ll be diligent with it, or if I’ll even want to be. I’m specifically planning challenges that I know will be uncomfortable, and that I may not be able to accomplish. The excitement is around creating experiences, a journey, which will allow me to get more out of life.

So cheers to what’s next.
