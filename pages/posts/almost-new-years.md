### It's almost time to get started!

So I have been talking with people more about the challenge and what I intend to do for some of them, as well as the complexity of figuring out the right order. However, it's been brought up that I really don't need to pre-establish all 9 challenges before the 2023. In a planning phase, I was focused on laying out all the details, but of course, there is time throughout the year to continue to establish exactly what challenges in what order makes sense. In fact, I may come up with new ideas during the year that I like better than my current list.

So I'm planning to share my current short and long list here, and then lock-in the first 3-4 challenges. Then, I'll establish the remaining challanges throughout the year. Also, my running goals play an important role in timing of challenges - I don't want to be attempting a phsyical challenge while also in final weeks of marathon training. So that general schedule is at the bottom.

## The short list:
&#x2611;  Read 30 minutes daily

&#x2611;  Learn and play chess

&#x2611;  No alcohol

&#x2611;  Get visible abs

&#9744;  Meditate daily

&#9744;  Slack lining, then go high-lining somewhere

&#9744;  Play the piano

&#9744;  Take survival course, read about it, then have a trip to put skills to use

&#9744;  Journal daily

&#9744;  Indoor rock climbing

## The long list:
&#9744;  Eat vegan/vegetarian

&#9744;  Learn to surf (practice x times per week)

&#9744;  Learn a new (programming) language/framework/etc

&#9744;  Learn to play the piano (keyboard)

&#9744;  Practice sketching

&#9744;  hike a new peak each weekend (4 highest in SoCal? Do you need lottery ticket for any?)

&#9744;  learn Spanish

&#9744;  Join a league at beach city sports

## Additional one-off ideas:
&#9744;  Fasting

&#9744;  Run a 50 mile race

&#9744;  Do the David Gogin’s challenge

&#9744;  Run a sub 20min 5k

&#9744;  Run a sub 7:30 pace half marathon

&#9744;  Run a sub 8:15 pace marathon

&#9744;  Drive Mulholland Dr

&#9744;  Go skiing

&#9744;  Fastpack a hike

&#9744;  Run a Ragnar relay

&#9744;  Use inside tracker

## General ideas
&#9744;  Something at altitude/exposure

&#9744;  Coldwater experience
