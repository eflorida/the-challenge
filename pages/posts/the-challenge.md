### So what is the challenge?

Well the plan was inspired by various inputs, but the general idea was to plan out specific habits and milestones to attempt in 1 year. Habits will be things like meditate daily for a month. Milestones will be things like run a 5k in under 20 minutes. I’m working on coordinating everything so that the habits help the milestones, and things generally stack to help accomplish the more difficult efforts.

Daily tasks are a difficult thing for me in general. My brain doesn’t like doing the same thing over and over, or doing it the same way each time, or worst of all, creating a routine. I’ve read plenty of books, blogs, and research to know that turning tasks into habits into routines is a powerful efficiency method to reduce the cognitive load required to accomplish daily tasks. I generally consider myself quite productive, but I rarely do the same things in the same way, multiple days in a row. So the hardest part bout “do `X` daily” is generally the “daily” part, not whatever `X` is.

The original thought was that everything would be in the habit category and I would either build a list of 12 to complete monthly, or 9 for 40 days each (5 days short of a year). 40 days was chosen based on my milestone birthday, but apparently it’s also a common time frame reference, ie, menstrual cycles, biblical references, etc. Anyways, as I continued building the list, I started coming up with ideas that more of one-off challenges and not habit forming.

I’m still hashing out all the details, but a proper calendar of activities will follow before the end of the year. The first milestone on this journey is to solidify the list and then spend the next year, sticking to it!
